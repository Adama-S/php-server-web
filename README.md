# php-server-web
This project must be consider as student test project which must be finished.
This is a sample project for a basic web server. Some test are written but they are not all passing. 

## installing 

`composer install`

## running server

`php bin/start_app.php`

To play with the server, just open chrome at http://localhost:1234/
Enjoy

(you can only do this after work number one is finished)

## Work number one

Your job is to make all test pass. 

You must use git and deliver a zip with the .git folder to track your work. 

No library shall be use. 

## Work numer two

Create a RESPONSE.md where will answer the following questions.

1. Now that you have writtent all test, you can try to use your server with a real browser. Play a little with it to identify the test which was not corresponding to the expected behavior. Which test is it and how should have been the expected response ?
2. Can you explain why there is a `Factory` class. To help you, this is not to be pretty, this is not required by php. 
So why ?
3. This is an open question. The test of the `HttpProcol` class is lacking of basic test. Can you add some test cases.
